# networks. The default value 'local' is useful for single-box testing
# but provides no connectivity between hosts.

# =========== items for MTU selection and advertisement =============
# (IntOpt) Path MTU.  The maximum permissible size of an unfragmented
# packet travelling from and to addresses where encapsulated Neutron
# traffic is sent.  Drivers calculate maximum viable MTU for
# validating tenant requests based on this value (typically,
# path_mtu - max encap header size).  If <=0, the path MTU is
# indeterminate and no calculation takes place.
# path_mtu = 0

# (IntOpt) Segment MTU.  The maximum permissible size of an
# unfragmented packet travelling a L2 network segment.  If <=0,
# the segment MTU is indeterminate and no calculation takes place.
# segment_mtu = 0

# (ListOpt) Physical network MTUs.  List of mappings of physical
# network to MTU value.  The format of the mapping is
# <physnet>:<mtu val>.  This mapping allows specifying a
# physical network MTU value that differs from the default
# segment_mtu value.
